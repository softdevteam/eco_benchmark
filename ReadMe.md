Incremental parser performance benchmark

This experiment requires the Java 1.5 Standard Library which can be downloaded
from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/archive-139210.html. The library can
be extracted from the `src.zip` archive contained within the Java Development
Kit 5.0.

After extracting the library into a folder named `javastdlib5`, the benchmark
can be run with `./build.sh`.

Afterwards, a PDF graph can be generated from the data with `./plot.py`.
